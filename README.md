This is a document in progress.

I think authorship should be open to everyone who wants to participate in writing the paper and who has contributed to the RDKit. This includes participation on the mailing list, submitting bug reports/feature requests, contributing code, tutorials or documentation, etc. Feel free to submit suggestions or, preferably, pull requests.

This shouldn't be too long; I'm targeting this as an application note. Once it's complete, and hopefully we'll recognize that point, I'll submit it somewhere that allows open-access publication of articles.
